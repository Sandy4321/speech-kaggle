My basic solution for [Speech Recognition problem at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge).

It demonstrates accuracy .76 on the leaderboard (obviously not cool).
However it's my first solution for a speech recognition, and it's written from scratch - a nice weekend exercise!
